Q1)List 5 difference between Browser JS(console) v Nodejs
Ans: Node JS-1)Node.js javascript code gets executed outside the browser as it is an interpreter as well as an environment for running javascript and used for server-side applications.(Browser.js is used for frontend)
             2)Node.js has full system access i.e can read and write directly to the file system like any other application
             3)In Node.js many objects are missing like “window”,“location”and “document”. 
             4)Node.js runs in a V8 engine which is mainly used by google chrome.
             5)Node.js is headless i.e without any GUI 

     Browser JS-1)Browser.js is mainly used for client-side applications like validations on a web page or dynamic page display and as the name suggests it gets executed in the browser only(Node.jS is used for Backend).
               2)Browser.js sandboxed for the safety purposes and have access limited to the browser. Hence it cannot write a code for a software.
               3)Browser.JS misses global” and “require” Objects.
               4)Browser.js runs any engine like Spider monkey (Firefox), JavaScript Core (Safari), V8 (Google Chrome)
